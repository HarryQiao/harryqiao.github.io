# Summary of My Observations

The first part of this lab was conducted during the two weeks of online classes. In HM Online 2.0, the environment and objects were mostly set, and people and interactions were the more significant features. The environments for HM Online 2.0 were students’ and teachers’ homes and Zoom App. I consider Zoom App to be an environment, not an object, because it was the medium of the vast majority of interactions. Laptop, desktop, and other devices, internet connections and family members make up the objects, since they had the potential to interfere with the activities of students and teachers. For example, some of my teachers have young kids at home. Sometimes, class had to be stopped because of the noise in the background. This happened twice in the three chemistry classes online. Internet connections and devices also had an impact on online school life. I recorded many occasions of students dropping out of Zoom, then joining back because of wi-fi issues. When I was doing remote learning, my steel drum teacher’s laptop died in the middle of the class when he was passionately playing with the band. He never noticed. There was also confusion and awkwardness in general when school was online, along with lots of repeating sentences. I recorded five occasions of myself leaving Zoom too slow, making the teacher think that I had questions, and then, just as the teacher would ask me if I had any questions, I would leave Zoom and then be unable to join back, since the teacher had closed the room. I had to email teachers several times to explain what had happened.

HM in-person, on the other hand, is a whole different experience. I was on campus for the first day in seven months when I did my data collection during class. Because of COVID-19, the school made big adjustments for our safety. I was able to make observations on the change in environment and objects. I recorded multiple times that when I walked on the main field, the majority of tents were not being used as classrooms. Up until this point, I have not seen a person in the lower gym (I thought it was converted to a study hall). This different environment of course leads to different interactions. On the main field, there were students playing soccer, or having PE classes not far away from other students sitting in circles, eating and talking. There were always lines in front of the pizza station. I also recorded at least five occasions when the teacher asked me to speak louder because I am not used to speaking through a face mask.
