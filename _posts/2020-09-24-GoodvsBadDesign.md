There are countless good and bad designs in the world. Lately, I discovered an interesting comparison between two apps: WeChat and WeCom. Because of Trump’s threat of banning WeChat, I was almost forced to fire up a WeCom account in order to maintain contact with friends and relatives in China. Both WeChat and WeCom are social apps developed by the Chinese company Tencent. However, these two apps have different customers. The customer for WeChat is everyone whereas WeCom is for enterprises. For many people, WeCom is known as the enterprise version of WeChat. 

# Good Design

WeChat is my example of good design. It is the main social network used in China and has more than one billion users around the world. The app is widely praised in China because it is so easy to use. Users can use WeChat to chat, make voice and video calls, post images to all friends, and many other small functions. What I consider the most important function is WeChat Pay. Because of it, the use of cash and credit cards reduce significantly. What I like about his app as a customer is that the signifiers are very obvious. From registering an account to actually use it, the app flows very naturally. 

# Bad Design

WeCom is my example of bad design. Although my opinion is very biased (since I am not a targeted customer), my experience and my relatives’ experiences should at least say something about the app. When my mom set up an account, she was assigned to a random company with people she never heard of (probably caused by an unclear signifier). My aunt on the other hand was able to set up an account without chaos. But when she tried to add friends on WeChat (yes, users between two platforms can communicate with each other), she put all of her friends in one group. I can’t see an experience to be more awkward than that. Although I was able to add my WeChat contacts without any award experience. It is still unclear to me how the company chat, interal, external chats, and DMs hierarchy works. Even though this app is not developed for the mainstream public, the discoverability for this app is yet to be improved.
