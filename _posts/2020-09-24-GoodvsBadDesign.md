There are countless good and bad designs in the world. Lately, I discovered an interesting comparison between two apps: WeChat and WeCom. Because of Trump’s threat of banning WeChat, many WeChat users in the United States begin to setup a WeCom account in order to maintain contact with friends and relatives in China. Both WeChat and WeCom are social apps developed by the Chinese company Tencent. However, these two apps have different customers. The customer for WeChat is everyone whereas WeCom is for enterprises. For many people, WeCom is known as the enterprise version of WeChat. 

# Good Design

WeChat is my example of good design. It is the main social network used in China and has more than one billion users around the world. The app is widely praised in China because it is so easy to use. Wechat's affordances include chatting, making voice and video calls, posting images and videos to all friends or public, following official accounts created by businesses and organizations, paying bills and many other small functions. Because Tencent is a very versatile tech company, they built their own system. This system includes video games, shows, and many other areas. All of these areas are linked together to WeChat. For example, I play the Chinese server of Arena of Valor, which is owned by Tencent, and I am able to sign in with my WeChat account. There is also another block that I want to go into more detail: WeChat Pay. Any user can connect their cards and bank account to WeChat Pay after uploading a government issued ID.  WeChat pay has the affordance to to pay for cell phone services, monthly bills, food deliveries, tickets for train, flights, movies, etc. Because it is so easy to use, cash and credit cards become less popular. This app also has good signifiers and feedback.  From registering an account to actually using it, the app flows very naturally. Users generally have a satisfying experience. However, I do want to mention that WeChat downloaded from the App Store with regions outside of China has less affordances (WeChat Pay is among them).

# Bad Design

WeCom is my example of bad design. Although my opinion is very biased (since I am not a targeted customer), my experience and my relatives’ experiences should at least say something about the app. When my mom set up an account, she was assigned to a random company with people she never heard of (probably caused by an unclear signifier). My aunt on the other hand was able to set up an account without chaos. But when she tried to add friends on WeChat (yes, users between two platforms can communicate with each other), she put all of her friends in one group. I can’t see an experience to be more awkward than that. Although I was able to add my WeChat contacts without any award experience. It is still unclear to me how the company chat, interal, external chats, and DMs hierarchy works. Even though this app is not developed for the mainstream public, the discoverability for this app is yet to be improved.
